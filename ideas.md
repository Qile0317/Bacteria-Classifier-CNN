- i may need to retrain with slightly simpler resnets to prevent overfitting bc it looks like its slightly overfitting
- i also should train a net to recognize data that is too empty and create a new flder with images that arent mostly white.
- i also should retrain with different yellow/blue tints to represent different camera lighting/image qualities
- it might help to train several nets with different resolution images and have a simple algo to choose which redily made model to deploy based on img size
